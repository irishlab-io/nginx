# nginx-hw

A simple hello world container in nginx.

## Key Goals

1. Build a minimalistic container with simple configuation\customization.
2. Learn reusable workflows for CI-CD Pipelines
3. Test various sets of toolchain and frameworks

## Workloads

## CI-CD Pipelines

A CI/CD pipeline is a series of automated steps that helps software teams deliver code faster, safer, and more reliably. Pipelines are an essential part of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) and are critical for modern software development.

### Continous Integration (CI)

Continuous integration (CI) is a process in which developers continually commit code in small increments—sometimes multiple times a day—which is then automatically built and tested before it is merged with the shared repository.

### Continous Delivery  (CD)

Continuous delivery (CD) extends CI by automatically deploying all code changes to a QA and/or production environment after the build stage. This ensures that you can release new changes to your customers quickly and sustainably. This practice helps developers automate the deployment process, minimize bugs in production, and increase the speed of software releases.
